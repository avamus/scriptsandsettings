      fullScript: "INTRO (Be Excited, Confident, and Assumptive)\n\nOUTBOUND - Hi [FIRST NAME] this is [YOUR NAME] calling from Tallbridge Investments. I am one of the Sr. buying specialist here. Your file came across my desk from our junior associate regarding the property at [ADDRESS].\n\nINBOUND - This is [YOUR NAME] How can I help you (Make it personal. Do you not use company name?)\n\nJust want to confirm some of the property details, I apologize in advance if some what we discuss is redundant but want to make sure I have all the correct facts so we can give you our best offer.\n\nSETTING THE STAGE\n• Great...Typically, people who call us want to know what we do, how we do it, & how much we can offer for their property... those kinds of things. Do you have those same types of questions?\n\n• Firstly, we are Real Estate Investment Company. We work with a group of investors and we buy in AS IS condition, all cash and can close in your timeframe. Sometimes in as little as a few days. There are no hidden fees, real-estate commission and we pay all closing costs! Make sense?\n\n• This process takes about 7 minutes. Sound good?\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n• Is it ok if I start by confirming your full name and the address of the property please?\n• Is this the best phone number for you?\n• Where would you like us to email our offer and contact information to?\n\nPROPERTY CONDITION\nNow I'm going to run through some quick questions about the property, ok?\n1. How long have you owned the property?\n2. Is it occupied?\n3. Obviously, we are not together in your property but let's imagine for moment we are. What's the general condition of the house?\n4. How many bedrooms and bathrooms?\n5. Are there any major repairs that need to be done?\n6. Does the house have any special features?\n7. Have the roof or windows ever been replaced?\n8. Have the kitchens and bathrooms been fully updated recently?\n9. Is there anything else you would like to tell me about the property?\n\nMOTIVATION (MIRROR AND LABEL)\nThis sounds like a property we might be interested in ...\n• Why are you thinking about selling it?\n\nMOTIVATION (Diving Deeper)\n• Really?\n• How long have you been thinking about selling?\n\nTIMELINE\n• If you did decide to sell to us or anyone else, would you like to do so within 30 days, 90 days, or further out?\n\nAMOUNT OWED\n• If we buy the property, will we need to pay off any taxes, liens, or a mortgage?\n• (If So) Do you have a rough idea of how much?\n\nHOME VALUE\n• I haven't done my research yet...BUT Considering Condition, (repeat the repairs needed) did you have any idea as to what you think it might be worth or WHAT you need to at least sell it for? Is that your asking price?\n\nNEGOTIATE\n• If we can cover all the closing costs, fees and commissions for you, and close on a timeframe that works best for you, what is the best price you can do?\n• Good Price: (If yes, move to close!)\n• Bad price: Go over what they said needs be done to the property give approximate prices of similar properties, touch on pain points and time\n• We are close, I think we can get a deal done\n\nCLOSE\n• Okay, let me do this. I'm going to speak with my partner quick to see if we can do that price. I'm not sure if it is, but if it is a price, we can do what would be THE deciding factor on signing a contract today?\n• Perfect. Is it okay if I put on hold? Super important.\n• Okay, well I've got great news! It looks like we can do that price. So, the next step is I'm going to send you over an email so we can review the agreement together. What is the best email for you?\n• Alright great. When would you be able to get in front of a computer or have access to your email?"
